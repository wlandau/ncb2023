# NCB 2023 short course: Bayesian methods for nonclinical statisticians

Bayesian methods have several advantages in the nonclincial space. Relative to the traditional frequentist paradigm, Bayesian models are more capable of nuanced inference, straightforward interpretation, quantification of prior evidence, and borrowing information across the features of a dataset. In this short course, we will introduce the Bayesian paradigm and motivate use cases in CMC, discovery, safety, and pharmacology. In addition, we will introduce Bayesian computation with JAGS and Stan so participants can begin implementing their first Bayesian analyses.

# Instructors

Luwis Diya earned his PhD from KU Leuven in 2011, where he applied Bayesian multilevel modeling techniques to explore the relationship between patient safety, in particular adverse events, and nurse staffing levels based on register-based databases (Belgian health outcomes data base and Belgian nurse staffing data base). He also did post-doctoral research at Karolinska Institute (2011-2012) on familial cancers based on the Swedish cancer registry. He works at Janssen Pharmaceutica NV (Johnson & Johnson), from 2012-2020 he provided statistical support for Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls and from 2020 he switched to providing statistical support to Discovery Sciences, in particular the Oncology Therapeutic Area. In his work, he advocates for the use of the Bayesian approach through interfaces in the R software.   

Will Landau earned his PhD from Iowa State University in 2016, where his dissertation research applied Bayesian methods, hierarchical models, and GPU computing to the analysis of RNA-seq data. He works at Eli Lilly and Company, where he develops Bayesian methods and software for clinical statisticians. His current work includes models for Alzheimer’s, chronic pain, and historical borrowing, as well as R packages for computationally demanding statistical workflows such as the design and simulation of clinical trials.
