The [presentation slides on practical strategies for Bayesian computation](https://github.com/wlandau/ncb2023/blob/main/2-computation/slides.pdf) was written by Dr. David Kahle from Baylor University. The [MCMC checklist](https://github.com/wlandau/ncb2023/blob/main/2-computation/mcmc_checklist.pdf) was written by Drs. John Seaman, David Kahle, and James Stamey from Baylor. The authors have granted permission to include these materials in this short course.

A later version of the [MCMC checklist](https://github.com/wlandau/ncb2023/blob/main/2-computation/mcmc_checklist.pdf) is included in the appendix of [Bayesian Applications in Pharmaceutical Development](https://www.routledge.com/Bayesian-Applications-in-Pharmaceutical-Development/Lakshminarayanan-Natanegara/p/book/9781032177021). Similar material may be found in [Case Studies in Bayesian Methods for Biopharmaceutical CMC](https://www.routledge.com/Case-Studies-in-Bayesian-Methods-for-Biopharmaceutical-CMC/Faya-Pourmohamad/p/book/9781032185484).
